<p class="calibri"><b>Questions</b></p>
<p class="calibri"><b>1</b> - <span class="arial">Assuming the volunteers are representative of the city's population, characterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify. For each area you identify, provide your rationale and supporting data. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.</span></p>
<p class="calibri"><i>
    The analysis of population distribution reveals distinct urban patterns in Engagement. The population density heatmap (Fig.1) shows clear high-density clusters, particularly in the northwest region (around coordinates -4000, 7000), the central area (0, 5000), and several other concentrated zones throughout the city. These high-density areas are characterized by darker red colors indicating populations exceeding 30 participants per grid cell.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/population.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.1: Population Density</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/house_size.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.2: Average Household Size</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/apartments.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.3: Apartment Locations</small></div>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    Comparing Fig.1 with Fig.3, there is a clear correlation between high population density areas and apartment building concentration. The dense residential hubs visible in the population heatmap correspond precisely to clusters of apartment buildings shown in blue in Fig.3. These areas represent typical urban apartment neighborhoods where vertical housing enables high population concentrations.
    <br><br>
    However, the household size analysis (Fig.2) reveals an important distinction in residential patterns. While some areas show high population density, certain residential zones—particularly in the southern and eastern periphery—display larger average household sizes (2.5-3.0 people, shown in darker red). Despite being residential areas, these zones exhibit lower population density in Fig.1. This pattern indicates the presence of larger single-family homes or spacious residential properties where families live with more square footage per person, resulting in lower overall population density even though the areas are primarily residential. These low-density residential areas represent suburban-style neighborhoods within the city limits.
    <br><br>
    <b>Employment and Commercial Districts</b><br>
    The employment distribution (Fig.4) reveals a distinct separation between residential and commercial zones. Employers (shown in red) are concentrated in specific corridors and clusters that largely avoid the densest residential areas. The most prominent employment zones include a central business district running east-west through the middle of the city, and several smaller commercial hubs distributed throughout the urban area.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/employers.png" style="max-width: 350px;"><br><small>Fig.4: Apartments (green) and Employers (red)</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/employer_count.png" style="max-width: 350px;"><br><small>Fig.5: Employer Density Heatmap</small></div>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The employer density heatmap (Fig.5) quantifies this concentration, with the darkest areas showing 6-8 employers per grid cell. These high-concentration zones form a clear commercial corridor through the city center (around coordinates -1500 to 500, 4000-6000) and several secondary commercial nodes. The spatial separation between residential apartments (green in Fig.4) and employment centers (red) indicates a typical urban structure where people commute from residential neighborhoods to distinct work districts, creating predictable traffic patterns between these zones during peak hours.
    <br><br>
    <b>Demographic Patterns: Family Distribution</b><br>
    A strong correlation emerges between household size (Fig.6) and families with children (Fig.7). The spatial distribution patterns in both heatmaps are remarkably similar, with high-value zones (dark red) appearing in nearly identical locations. Areas with larger household sizes (2.5-3.0+ people) consistently correspond to areas where 80-100% of families have children, indicating strong family-oriented neighborhoods.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/house_size.png" style="max-width: 350px;"><br><small>Fig.6: Average Household Size</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/kids.png" style="max-width: 350px;"><br><small>Fig.7: % of Families with Children</small></div>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    This strong correlation demonstrates that family-oriented neighborhoods are clearly identifiable through either metric. The regions in the southern areas (around y=1000-2000), eastern periphery, and several smaller clusters show the strongest concentration of families with children. In these zones, 80-100% of households include children, suggesting the presence of larger homes, good schools, and family-friendly amenities. Conversely, the central high-density apartment areas show lighter colors in both maps—smaller households where fewer than 40% of families have children—typical of young professionals, couples without children, or retirees in urban cores.
    <br><br>
    <b>Income Distribution: Economic Homogeneity</b><br>
    The income distribution heatmap (Fig.8) reveals a notable characteristic of Engagement: the city exhibits remarkable economic homogeneity with no significant high-income or low-income districts. The map shows predominantly light yellow tones across almost the entire urban area, indicating average income levels between $50,000-100,000 throughout most neighborhoods.

    <img src="report/1/income.png" style="max-width: 400px;"><br><small>Fig.8: Average Income Distribution</small>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    Only a few isolated cells show slightly elevated income levels (darker red-orange, reaching $150,000-200,000), but these are scattered anomalies rather than cohesive affluent districts.
