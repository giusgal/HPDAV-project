<p class="calibri"><b><u>Urban Density and Residential Typologies</u></b></p>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The analysis of population distribution reveals distinct urban patterns in Engagement. The population density heatmap (Fig.1) shows clear high-density clusters concentrated in specific regions throughout the city, characterized by darker red colors indicating populations exceeding 30 participants per grid cell.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/population.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.1: Population Density</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/house_size.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.2: Average Household Size</small></div>

</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    Comparing Fig.1 with Fig.3, there is a clear correlation between high population density areas and apartment building concentration. The dense residential hubs visible in the population heatmap correspond precisely to clusters of apartment buildings. These areas represent typical urban apartment neighborhoods where vertical housing enables high population concentrations.
    <br><br>
    Distinct residential zones emerge from the data. High-density apartment neighborhoods with predominantly smaller households contrast sharply with peripheral residential areas characterized by larger average household sizes (2.5-3.0 people, shown in Fig.2). These suburban-style neighborhoods show lower population density despite being residential because families occupy larger homes with more square footage per person.
    <br><br>
    <b>Family-Oriented Neighborhoods</b><br>
    A strong correlation exists between household size and families with children (Fig.2 and Fig.4). The spatial distribution patterns are remarkably similar, with high-value zones appearing in nearly identical locations. Areas with larger household sizes consistently correspond to zones where 80-100% of families have children, indicating strong family-oriented neighborhoods in the southern and eastern areas, as well as several smaller clusters. In these zones, the concentration of households with children suggests the presence of larger homes, good schools, and family-friendly amenities.
    <br><br>
    Conversely, the central high-density apartment areas show lighter colors in Fig.4—smaller households where fewer than 40% of families have children—typical of young professionals, couples without children, or retirees in urban cores.
    <br><br>
    <b>Employment and Commercial Districts</b><br>
    The employment distribution (Fig.5) reveals a distinct separation between residential and commercial zones. Employers are concentrated in specific corridors and clusters that largely avoid the densest residential areas. The most prominent employment zones include a central business district and several smaller commercial hubs distributed throughout the urban area.

</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The employer density heatmap (Fig.6) quantifies this concentration with the darkest areas showing 6-8 employers per grid cell. These high-concentration zones form a clear commercial corridor through the city center and several secondary commercial nodes. The spatial separation between residential apartments and employment centers indicates a typical urban structure where people commute from residential neighborhoods to distinct work districts, creating predictable traffic patterns during peak hours.
    <br><br>
    <b>Economic Patterns</b><br>
    The income distribution heatmap (Fig.7) reveals remarkable economic homogeneity. The city exhibits no significant high-income or low-income districts, with predominantly light yellow tones across almost the entire urban area indicating average income levels between $50,000-100,000. Only a few isolated cells show slightly elevated income levels, representing scattered anomalies rather than cohesive affluent districts.

<p class="calibri"><b>3</b> - <span class="arial">Participants have given permission to have their daily routines captured. Choose two different participants with different routines and describe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.</span></p>
<p class="calibri"><i>
    We selected <b>Participant 1</b> (Age 5, HighSchoolOrCollege) and <b>Participant 609</b> (Age 42, Bachelors) to compare two distinctly different daily routines.<br><br>
    
    <b>Time Allocation Analysis (Parallel Coordinates)</b><br>
    The parallel coordinates chart (Fig.8) reveals significant differences in how these participants allocate their time. Participant 609 (green) dedicates substantially more time to work (~1,300 minutes) compared to Participant 1 (red, ~1,000 minutes), consistent with a full-time professional. Conversely, Participant 1 spends more time at home (~1,150 vs ~800 minutes), which aligns with a student lifestyle requiring less workplace presence. Both participants show similar social activity levels (~550 minutes), but Participant 609 spends more on food-related activities (~700 vs ~500 minutes), suggesting more restaurant visits or longer meal breaks. Travel times are comparable (~800-900 minutes).<br><br>
    
    <b>Weekday Patterns</b><br>
    The daily routine visualization (Fig.9) shows clear structural differences on weekdays. Participant 1 follows a typical student schedule: leaving home around 8:00, spending the core hours (9:00-17:00) at work/school, then engaging in recreation activities in the late afternoon before returning home. Participant 609 exhibits a classic professional routine: departing home earlier around 7:00, working longer continuous hours until approximately 18:00, with brief lunch breaks, followed by recreation or restaurant visits in the evening before returning home.<br><br>
    
    <b>Weekend Patterns</b><br>
    Weekend behaviors (Fig.10) reveal the most striking differences. Participant 1 spends the majority of weekend time at home with occasional evening recreation activities. Participant 609, while also home-based on weekends, shows more frequent outings for recreation and social activities, particularly in the afternoon and evening hours. This suggests a more active social lifestyle typical of a working adult seeking leisure activities on non-work days.<br><br>
    
    <b>Geographic Patterns</b><br>
    The travel route maps reveal distinct geographic footprints. Participant 1 (blue routes) lives in the northern residential area and commutes to a workplace in the upper-central district, with recreation venues visited along a relatively compact corridor. Participant 609 (orange routes) resides in the central-southern area and works in the southern business district, covering a larger geographic area and visiting more diverse venues across the city, including multiple restaurants and pubs.<br><br>
    
    <b>Summary</b><br>
    These two participants represent contrasting urban lifestyles: Participant 1 embodies a student-like routine with shorter work hours, more home time, and localized travel patterns; Participant 609 represents a mature professional with extended work hours, broader social engagement, and more extensive city exploration.
