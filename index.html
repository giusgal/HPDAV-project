<p class="calibri"><b>1</b> - <span class="arial">Assuming the volunteers are representative of the city's population, characterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify.

<p class="calibri"><b><u>Urban Density and Residential Typologies</u></b></p>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The analysis of population distribution reveals distinct urban patterns in Engagement. The population density heatmap (Fig.1) shows clear high-density clusters concentrated in specific regions throughout the city, characterized by darker red colors indicating populations exceeding 30 participants per grid cell.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/population.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.1: Population Density</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/house_size.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.2: Average Household Size</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/apartments.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.3: Apartment Locations</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/kids.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.4: % of Families with Children</small></div>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    Comparing Fig.1 with Fig.3, there is a clear correlation between high population density areas and apartment building concentration. The dense residential hubs visible in the population heatmap correspond precisely to clusters of apartment buildings. These areas represent typical urban apartment neighborhoods where vertical housing enables high population concentrations.
    <br><br>
    Distinct residential zones emerge from the data. High-density apartment neighborhoods with predominantly smaller households contrast sharply with peripheral residential areas characterized by larger average household sizes (2.5-3.0 people, shown in Fig.2). These suburban-style neighborhoods show lower population density despite being residential because families occupy larger homes with more square footage per person.
    <br><br>
    <b>Family-Oriented Neighborhoods</b><br>
    A strong correlation exists between household size and families with children (Fig.2 and Fig.4). The spatial distribution patterns are remarkably similar, with high-value zones appearing in nearly identical locations. Areas with larger household sizes consistently correspond to zones where 80-100% of families have children, indicating strong family-oriented neighborhoods in the southern and eastern areas, as well as several smaller clusters. In these zones, the concentration of households with children suggests the presence of larger homes, good schools, and family-friendly amenities.
    <br><br>
    Conversely, the central high-density apartment areas show lighter colors in Fig.4—smaller households where fewer than 40% of families have children—typical of young professionals, couples without children, or retirees in urban cores.
    <br><br>
    <b>Employment and Commercial Districts</b><br>
    The employment distribution (Fig.5) reveals a distinct separation between residential and commercial zones. Employers are concentrated in specific corridors and clusters that largely avoid the densest residential areas. The most prominent employment zones include a central business district and several smaller commercial hubs distributed throughout the urban area.

    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/employer_count.png" style="max-width: 350px;"><br><small>Fig.6: Employer Density Heatmap</small></div>
</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The employer density heatmap (Fig.6) quantifies this concentration with the darkest areas showing 6-8 employers per grid cell. These high-concentration zones form a clear commercial corridor through the city center and several secondary commercial nodes. The spatial separation between residential apartments and employment centers indicates a typical urban structure where people commute from residential neighborhoods to distinct work districts, creating predictable traffic patterns during peak hours.
    <br><br>
    <b>Economic Patterns</b><br>
    The income distribution heatmap (Fig.7) reveals remarkable economic homogeneity. The city exhibits no significant high-income or low-income districts, with predominantly light yellow tones across almost the entire urban area indicating average income levels between $50,000-100,000. Only a few isolated cells show slightly elevated income levels, representing scattered anomalies rather than cohesive affluent districts.
