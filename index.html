<p class="calibri"><b>Questions</b></p>
<p class="calibri"><b>1</b> - <span class="arial">Assuming the volunteers are representative of the city's population, characterize the distinct areas of the city that you identify.

<p class="calibri"><b><u>Urban Density and Residential Typologies</u></b></p>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The analysis of population distribution reveals distinct urban patterns in Engagement. The population density heatmap (Fig.1) shows clear high-density clusters concentrated in specific regions throughout the city, characterized by darker red colors indicating populations exceeding 30 participants per grid cell.
</i></p>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/population.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.1: Population Density</small></div>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="report/1/house_size.png" style="max-width: 300px;"><br><small>Fig.2: Average Household Size</small></div>

</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    Comparing Fig.1 with Fig.3, there is a clear correlation between high population density areas and apartment building concentration. The dense residential hubs visible in the population heatmap correspond precisely to clusters of apartment buildings. These areas represent typical urban apartment neighborhoods where vertical housing enables high population concentrations.
    <br><br>
    Distinct residential zones emerge from the data. High-density apartment neighborhoods with predominantly smaller households contrast sharply with peripheral residential areas characterized by larger average household sizes (2.5-3.0 people, shown in Fig.2). These suburban-style neighborhoods show lower population density despite being residential because families occupy larger homes with more square footage per person.
    <br><br>
    <b>Family-Oriented Neighborhoods</b><br>
    A strong correlation exists between household size and families with children (Fig.2 and Fig.4). The spatial distribution patterns are remarkably similar, with high-value zones appearing in nearly identical locations. Areas with larger household sizes consistently correspond to zones where 80-100% of families have children, indicating strong family-oriented neighborhoods in the southern and eastern areas, as well as several smaller clusters. In these zones, the concentration of households with children suggests the presence of larger homes, good schools, and family-friendly amenities.
    <br><br>
    Conversely, the central high-density apartment areas show lighter colors in Fig.4—smaller households where fewer than 40% of families have children—typical of young professionals, couples without children, or retirees in urban cores.
    <br><br>
    <b>Employment and Commercial Districts</b><br>
    The employment distribution (Fig.5) reveals a distinct separation between residential and commercial zones. Employers are concentrated in specific corridors and clusters that largely avoid the densest residential areas. The most prominent employment zones include a central business district and several smaller commercial hubs distributed throughout the urban area.

</div>

<p class="calibri"><i>
    The employer density heatmap (Fig.6) quantifies this concentration with the darkest areas showing 6-8 employers per grid cell. These high-concentration zones form a clear commercial corridor through the city center and several secondary commercial nodes. The spatial separation between residential apartments and employment centers indicates a typical urban structure where people commute from residential neighborhoods to distinct work districts, creating predictable traffic patterns during peak hours.
    <br><br>
    <b>Economic Patterns</b><br>
    The income distribution heatmap (Fig.7) reveals remarkable economic homogeneity. The city exhibits no significant high-income or low-income districts, with predominantly light yellow tones across almost the entire urban area indicating average income levels between $50,000-100,000. Only a few isolated cells show slightly elevated income levels, representing scattered anomalies rather than cohesive affluent districts.

<p class="calibri"><b>3</b> - <span class="arial">Participants have given permission to have their daily routines captured. Choose two different participants with different routines and describe their daily patterns, with supporting evidence. Limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.</span></p>
<p class="calibri"><i>
    We selected <b>Participant 1</b> (Age 5, HighSchoolOrCollege) and <b>Participant 609</b> (Age 42, Bachelors) to compare two distinctly different daily routines.<br><br>
    
<b>Time Allocation Analysis (Parallel Coordinates)</b><br>
The parallel coordinates chart (Fig. 8) highlights clear differences in the number of recorded activities between the two participants. Participant 609 (green) shows a higher number of work activities, which include workplace visits and commuting trips, indicating a routine strongly centered on professional obligations. Participant 1 (red) presents fewer work activities, consistent with a shorter and more flexible study routine.<br><br>

A strong contrast appears in social activities. Participant 1 records a much higher number of social and recreational events, showing frequent leisure outings and a socially active lifestyle. Participant 609, in contrast, exhibits very limited social activity, suggesting that leisure plays a minor role in daily life.<br><br>

Participant 1 also shows more home activities, indicating frequent presence in the home environment, while Participant 609 records fewer home events. Food activities are more frequent for Participant 609, likely related to regular restaurant visits during the workday. Travel activity is observed for both participants, but Participant 1 moves for a wider range of purposes, whereas Participant 609 travels mainly for work related reasons.
<br><br>
    <b>Weekday Patterns</b><br>
    Participant 1 follows a shorter and more flexible routine, working or studying from 08:00 to 16:00, after which the day opens up to a variety of activities; the evening shows frequent social and recreational outings, and the travel patterns are diverse, connecting home, work/study, and multiple leisure locations, indicating a dynamic and socially active lifestyle. Participant 609, instead, has a longer and more structured workday from 08:00 to 18:00, with a clear lunch break, and spends most of the evening at home; their mobility is mainly limited to a repetitive home–work–home route, reflecting a stable, work-centered, and less varied daily routine.<br><br>
    
    <b>Weekend Patterns</b><br>
    During the weekend, Participant 1 shows a highly flexible and leisure-oriented routine, spending most of the day alternating between home, recreation, and restaurants with frequent short trips to multiple venues, indicating a socially active and exploratory use of time, whereas Participant 609 maintains a calmer and more home-centered pattern, with longer stays at home, limited outings mainly for meals or short recreational activities, and localized, repetitive travel routes around the residential area, reflecting a relaxed but still structured weekend lifestyle.<br><br>
        
    <b>Summary</b><br>
    Overall, the comparison highlights two distinct mobility and lifestyle patterns. Participant 1 shows higher daily mobility, characterized by frequent and varied movements between home, work or study, and multiple leisure venues, resulting in a dense and ramified set of travel routes. Despite shorter work hours, this participant is more spatially active and socially engaged. In contrast, Participant 609 follows a longer and more structured workday, with mobility largely concentrated along a limited number of repetitive routes, mainly between home and work. The overall routine is more stable and less diverse.
